The <b><i>Bullwinkle's Moosetronics Show</b></i> is an AVG and Dreamation animatronic show that was produced in 1982. The show itself is themed after the characters from cartoons such as *Rocky and Bullwinkle*, *Underdog*, *Hoppity Hooper*, *Dudley Do-Right* (a segment within *Rocky and Bullwinkle*,) and *Tooter Turtle*. Several of these shows were installed in various locations under different variants during the 1980s into the 1990s.
<h2> Stages </h2>
<h3> Description </h3> 
The stages had Rocky and Bullwinkle on Center Stage (Hoppity Hooper and Tooter Turtle included sometimes for some stages) and with a Boris and Natasha animatronic hanging overhead above the characters. The stage can also sometimes include Stages Right and Left for Dudley Do-Right and Underdog (for some stages.) The animatronics are programmed to perform songs that were composed by the late Bill Broughton and do skits to introduce the *Fantasy Fountain Show* (In some locations) or the show itself
<h3> Santa Clara Prototype Show </h3>
This was the first ever animatronic stage produced for Bullwinkle's. This stage wasn't made by AVG but was instead made by Fred Hope (who was a former Show Designer for Walt Disney Imagineering) and The Only Animated company. The stage from left to right consists of characters such as Dudley Do-Right, Tooter Turtle, Rocky, Boris and Natascha (from above,) Bullwinkle, Underdog, Hoppity Hooper, Chumley, and Tennessee Tuxedo. This stage was only exclusive to Santa Clara as it was never distributed to other locations. It is unknown what happened to the stage during the time of the store's existence. But it was most likely replaced by a regular A-Show stage. Hoppity Hooper from the Santa Clara location is currently owned by a private collector as of 2024.
<h3> A-Show </h3>
This was the finalized 3-Stage show that would be used for later Bullwinkle's Restaurant locations. This show was manufactured by AVG Technologies. The show itself completely eliminates Tennesse Tuxedo and Chumley from Stage Right and Underdog taking its place. These were widespread throughout many Bullwinkle's Restaurant locations until the Late 80s-1990s, when it was replaced by a scaled down version known as the B-Show.
<h3> B-Show </h3>
This is a scaled down version of the A-Show stage only containing Rocky, Bullwinkle, and Boris and Natascha. This stage was only exclusive to Family Fun Center and Bullwinkle's Restaurants that opened in the 1990s and so on. The reason for this scaled-down stage is unknown, but probably for maintenance and budget reasons. The last location to have this B-Show stage was the Wilsonville, OR location, when it was removed during a major renovation in 2019.
<h3> Northwoods A-Show </h3>
This stage was designed by Mozingo + Wallace Archetectures LLC and was the first Dreamation stage to be built. Only 3 locations had this stage such as Cary, NC, Medford, NY, and Myrtle Beach, SC. The last location to use this stage was the Medford, NY location, as it was closed in 2020. Its show is currently under the hands of a private collector. The theming was unique as it didn't follow the traditional cabin theme from earlier stages, with the characters having their own unique ways of being introduced without curtains. (Like Rocky and Bullwinkle emerging out of a fire station, Underdog behind a billboard, and Dudley Do-Right behind a police station window.) There was also a uniquely shaped door on the stage as well, possibly with a purpose for the Bullwinkle mascot to come out for the guests.
<h3> Tukwila B-Show </h3>
This is the last Bullwinkle's Moosetronic Show ever produced. This is only exclusive to the Tukwila, WA location and was manufactured by Dreamation. Instead of a Northwoods theme or a log cabin theme like the earlier A-Shows and B-Shows, this takes a theming of a theater box office with several posters hung around. This time, the stage is on a turntable, revealing the characters of Rocky and Bullwinkle during shows and the box office during intermissions. Tukwila is the last store in general to have a Bullwinkle's Moosetronic show as both Upland (being removed possibly during the acquisition by Boomers) and Wilsonville (during the 2019 remodel) had removed their shows respectively.
